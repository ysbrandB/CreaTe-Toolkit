## CreaTe toolkit
The CreaTe toolkit is a Laravel powered website developed for my Graduation Project for the study of Creative Technology.
It aims to make the creation of interactive systems easier by letting students choose the sensors and actuators they need for their project and then suggest a way to make these work together.
With every component the site also aims to provide enough documentation to help the student set up the hardware or software needed to make the interactive system work.

## Technologies
The website is made on top of the Laravel Breeze starter kit using Inertia to power the Vue.js frontend.
It is currently not recommended to deploy to production, as authentication is handled, but authorization is not implemented.
